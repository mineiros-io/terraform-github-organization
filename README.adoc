[.lead]
A Terraform module that acts as a wrapper around the Terraform https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/github/index.html[GitHub provider]
and offers a more convenient and tested way to manage GitHub Organizations following best practices.

[NOTE]
====
This module allows you to manage your GitHub organization's members settings easily.
It needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used and it cannot be use to provision new
organizations since this is not supported by the Terraform https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/github/index.html[GitHub provider].
====

[TIP]
====
This Module uses `For, For-Each and Dynamic Nested Blocks` that were introduced in Terraform 0.12.
A common problem in Terraform configurations for versions 0.11 and earlier is dealing with situations where the number
of values or resources is decided by a dynamic expression rather than a fixed count.

You can now dynamically add and remove items from and to Lists without
the necessity to render the whole list of resources again. Terraform will only add and remove the items you want it to.
