# terraform-github-organization

A [Terraform] module that acts as a wrapper around the Terraform
[GitHub provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/github/index.html) and offers a more convenient and tested way
to manage GitHub Organizations following best practices.

**_This module supports Terraform v1.x and is compatible with the Official Terraform GitHub Provider v4.x from `integrations/github`._**

**Attention: This module is incompatible with the Hashicorp GitHub Provider! The latest version of this module supporting `hashicorp/github` provider is `~> 0.6.0`**

## Module Features

- **Standard Module Features**:
  Organization Members,
  Organization Owners (Admins),
  Organization Projects,
  Blocked Users

- **Extended Module Features**:
  Change organization member roles without removing and re-inviting users,
  Rename projects without recreating (when providing unique ids),
  No need to import members/admins on first run,
  Create an all member team that contains every member of your organization

## Getting Started

To quickly start managing your GitHub Organization with Terraform:

```hcl
module "organization" {
  source  = "mineiros-io/organization/github"
  version = "~> 0.7.0"

  create_all_members_team = true

  members = [
    "a-user",
    "b-user",
  ]

  admins = [
    "a-admin",
  ]

  blocked_users = [
    "blocked-user",
    "another-blocked-user",
  ]

  projects = [
    {
      id   = "project-a"
      name = "A Great Project"
      body = "This is a project created by Terraform"
    }
  ]
}

provider "github" {}

terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.0"

  required_providers {
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
